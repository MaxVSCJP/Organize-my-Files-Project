Version 2
	- Added support for organizing code files
	- Now organizes photos by year and month 
	- Now organizes music by artist and album

- Videos will be in your Videos folder
- Music will be in your Music folder
- Photos will be in your Pictures folder

* If you want to see the code file and run the program yourself, use cmd, not an inbuilt terminal like in VS code (runs code but has a tendency to not work on proper folder/directory)
