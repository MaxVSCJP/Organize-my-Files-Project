# Organize my Files Project
 python script to basically organize my folders when i don't feel like it

Paste the .exe file into the folder you want to organize and run it.
    - It might get flagged as a virus because auto-py-to-exe was used to create it (unless it's the comptuer it was made on the .exe file would be unrecognized and flagged as a virus) but it's not.
    - It's a simple script that just moves files into folders based on their extension & some other parameters.
    - It's not perfect but it works for me.
    - If it does get flagged as a virus, you'd need to allow it to run in your antivirus software.
    - If you don't believe me you can take the code and run it yourself through cmd (from my experience, the terminal on VS code doesn't run your code from the proper directory, so the program would organize another folder than the one you have the .py file in ).

When it's run, a cmd window will pop up and close almost instantaneously; don't worry it's just the code being ran. 

Currently organizes:
    -folders
    -images
    -videos
    -audio
    -documents (Word, Powerpoint, Excel, PDF, HTML files, Text files)
    -subtitle files
    -compressed files
    -rainmeter skins
    -programs & applications file
    -torrent files
